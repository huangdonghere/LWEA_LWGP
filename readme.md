# Locally Weighted Ensemble Clustering

## Overview
This repository provides the MATLAB code for two ensemble clustering algorithms, namely, `locally weighted evidence accumulation (LWEA)` and `locally weighted graph partitioning (LWGP)`, which are proposed in the following paper:
```
Dong Huang, Chang-Dong Wang, and Jian-Huang Lai.
Locally Weighted Ensemble Clustering,
IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 2018, 48(5), pp.1460-1473.
```

## Description of Files
There are mainly two types of files in this repository:
1. A pool of 100 base clusterings for each dataset;  
2. The code of the LWEA and LWGP algorithms.

### Data

The base clustering pools for the 15 datasets are provided in the following MAT files:

```
dataName = 'VS';
dataName = 'Semeion';
dataName = 'SPF';
dataName = 'MF';
dataName = 'IS';
dataName = 'Caltech20';
dataName = 'FCT';
dataName = 'MNIST';
dataName = 'Texture';
dataName = 'ODR';
dataName = 'LS';
dataName = 'ISOLET';
dataName = 'PD';
dataName = 'USPS';
dataName = 'LR';
```

There are two variables in the MAT file for each dataset, namely, members and gt. The variable gt is the ground-truth label, which is an N-dimension vector. The variable members is an N x s matrix, where each column of it is a candidate base clustering.


### Code

The file entitled 'demo_LWEA_and_LWGP.m' is the main file for running LWEA and LWGP. You may change the following settings in order to test the performances of LWEA and LWGP:

```
1) dataName:	the dataset to be used.
2) M:           the ensemble size.
3) cntTimes:	run LWEA and LWGP for cntTimes times and obtain the average performance.
4) para_theta:	the parameter theta.
6) clsNums:     a vector of positve integers, specifying different numbers of clusters for LWEA and LWGP.
```

(Please note that M, cntTimes must be positive integers. The parameter para_theta must be greater than zero.)

The execution results and the variable 'bcIdx' will be saved in results_XXX.mat. The bcIdx is a cntTimes x M matrix and stores the information of the ensembles. Each row in bcIdx includes M indices for choosing base clusterings in the pool and thus represents an ensemble of M base clusterings. When comparing our approach to other approaches, please make sure that they use the same base clustering settings, i.e., use the ensembles generated by the same 'bcIdx'.
